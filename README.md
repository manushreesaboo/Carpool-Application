# Carpool-Application

My Carpool is proposed as a web application that connects the parents who want
to pool a car for their ward to the school. With this application, the parents can know about
the cars that carpool in the area. There would be options to create an account, search the
carpools in a particular pin code, create a carpool, join a carpool and receive notifications on
a personal level. The parent feels secure that the ward travels with students of the same
school, not strangers. The user can create an account with a unique username. While
registering as a user, the person is required to enter the ward’s school email Id and the app
would validate it. Each carpool is allowed to conduct its own terms and policies with everyone’s understanding 
and all the members mustabide the rules. This creates security and inculcates the quality of responsibility in all. 
The users would have an option to send a formal application to join a carpool after having a look
at the details of the carpool. The carpool members can accept or reject the application. To
develop this, I would use the languages of HTML, CSS and javascript. At the back end, I would
be running the application with PHP and MYSQL for the database.

Design of the solution
The solution would consist of one interface, the User interface (Dashboard).
The user interface would have the following interface:
1. Controlled access through a username and password
2. Ability to view the details of a carpool system.
3. Ability to join a carpool situated in his/her locality.
4. Ability to start a carpool system in his/her locality.
5. Ability to accept or reject applicants for the carpool the user created.
6. Ability to delete or leave the carpool system.
7. Ability to alter your personal information.
8. Ability to view notifications


Please note that the commited files do not perform all the actions as required. This presents a demo of the application.
